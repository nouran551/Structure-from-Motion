# Structure-from-Motion
This repository contains code for calculating the similarities between four images using the structure from motion algorithm.
# Output
The code will output a list of similarities between the four images. The similarities are calculated as the number of matches between the descriptors of each pair of images divided by the number of keypoints in the first image.
